# Functional vs Class components
## Functional Components
- They are simple functions.
- Use them as much as possible.
- Absence of 'this' keyword.
- Solution without using state.
- Mainly responsible for the UI.
- They are called as  Stateless/Dumb/Presentational components.

## Class Components
- More feature rich.
- Maintain their own private data => state.
- Complex UI logic.
- Provide lifecycle hooks.
- Thhey are called as Stateful/Smart/Container components.
